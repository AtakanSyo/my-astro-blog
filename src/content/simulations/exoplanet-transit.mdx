  <p>
    The animation places a short-period gas giant on an inclined orbit around a sun-like star. The star itself is alive with animated
    granulation—bright cells of rising plasma and darker lanes of cooler gas—while a soft corona hints at the extended stellar
    atmosphere. A thin orbit line marks the planet’s path so you can track where it is in three dimensions even when it slips behind the
    star.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the planet moves in front of the star from our point of view, it blocks a small fraction of starlight. The panel overlaying the
    simulation keeps you grounded: real-time brightness, orbital phase, inferred transit depth, and a friendly status label (Ingress,
    Mid-transit, or just “Passing in front”) update continuously. Below those numbers, the golden light-curve plot accumulates the data,
    producing the familiar “U” shaped dip seen in missions like <em>Kepler</em> and <em>TESS</em>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-the-dimming-works">How the dimming works</h2>
  <p>
    Even though the planet is much smaller than the star, the drop in light is measurable. For a Jupiter-sized world transiting a
    sun-sized star, the dip is roughly 1 percent. Shallow though it is, that signal repeats every orbit, allowing astronomers to infer
    the planet’s size, orbital period, and—combined with radial velocity data—its density. Because the star’s atmosphere is brighter in
    the centre than at the edges (limb darkening), the curve slopes gently down, flattens near mid-transit, then climbs back up. In this
    simulation we mimic that behaviour with a simple overlap model: the deeper the overlap between discs, the larger the temporary drop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice how the overlay reports a non-zero brightness even when the planet is still in front of the star but no longer overlapping it.
    In observational astronomy this would correspond to a near miss or grazing transit, and scientists keep an eye on those cases to
    better understand orbital inclinations. The panel makes those moments obvious without needing to squint at the plot.
  </p>

  <h2 id="try-it-yourself">Try it yourself</h2>
  <p>
    Press play to let the planet begin its orbit and watch the live brightness readout. You can tweak the component’s props in code—
    including the orbital period, planet radius, transit depth, and even the colour of the starfield—to model different systems. Want to
    mimic a super-Earth or a bloated ultra-hot Jupiter? Adjust <code>options</code> and see how the light curve responds. Try increasing
    <code>atmosphereIntensity</code> for a hazier world, or dial back <code>starGranulationStrength</code> if you prefer a smoother star.
    It’s an intuitive way to connect visual motion with the data that real surveys collect.
