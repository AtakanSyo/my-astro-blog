      <p class="home-description">
        I'm passionate about creating scientific-storytelling artifacts
        using 3-dimensional simulation tools such as Blender and WebGL. 
        I have a particular interest in astronomy & archeology.

        <h2>Review Content Types</h2>
        <p>
          I have integrated
        affiliate marketing to the blog as an immediate income source and as a way for me to be able 
        to keep making these posts.
          <strong>Review Posts</strong> are based on hands-on experience and direct testing of telescopes and astronomy gear (Huge thanks to Zane Landers).
          <strong>Overview Posts</strong> are based on in-depth research, manufacturer data, astronomy community feedback,
          and independent testing data from trusted sources. Both types aim to give you clear, honest, and useful information.
          You would better make your astronomy equipment decision here than other sources (I also recommend https://telescopicwatch.com, 
          as a reliable and expert driven source).

        <h2>Where to buy?</h2>
        <p>
          Consider choosing HighPointScientific as your main vendor for shipping safety and refunds.
          Amazon is viable, but has occasionally shipped astronomy gear with missing pieces and more 
          complex refund processes. I would recommend Amazon for smaller purchases.

        <h2>Affiliate Notice</h2>
        <p>
          I have affiliate programs with Amazon, HighPointScientific, and Astroshop.
          If you click on a link and make a purchase, I will receive a small commission.
          My content remains unbiased, your satisfaction with your purchase matters more than 
          short-term affiliate income.
