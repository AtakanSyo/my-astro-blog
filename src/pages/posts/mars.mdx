<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>Mars has been known since antiquity and observed by many civilizations, 
  including the Babylonians, Greeks, and Chinese.</p>

<h2>Name and Meaning</h2>
<p>Mars is named after the Roman god of war, reflecting its reddish, blood-like appearance. In many cultures, Mars’s color and wandering motion inspired myths linking it to conflict and omens.</p>


<h2>Distance from the Sun</h2>
<p>Mars is the <strong>4th planet from the Sun</strong>. Its average orbital distance is about 
  227.9 million km (1.52 AU). A Martian year lasts 687 Earth days. Because of its elliptical orbit, 
  The distance between Mars and Earth varies widely, producing favorable oppositions 
  roughly every 26 months.</p>

<h2>A Martian Day (Sol)</h2>
<p>A <em>sol</em>, the scientific term for a day on Mars, lasts about 24 hours and 39 minutes,
making it roughly 4 minutes longer than a day on Earth.</p>

<h2>Mars' Moons</h2>
<p>Mars has two small irregular moons, Phobos and Deimos, likely captured asteroids. 
  Phobos orbits so close that it is slowly spiraling inward and may break up into a ring 
  in tens of millions of years.</p>

<h2>Size and mass</h2>
<p>Mars has a diameter of 6,779 km and a mass about 10.7% of Earth’s. Gravity at the surface is roughly 38% of Earth’s, shaping dust transport, erosion, and potential human activity.</p>

<h2>Chemistry and atmosphere</h2>
<p>The surface is basaltic rock and dust rich in iron oxides, giving Mars its red hue. The atmosphere is thin and dominated by carbon dioxide (~95%), with nitrogen and argon making up most of the remainder. Seasonal CO₂ exchange at the poles drives pressure changes and weather patterns.</p>
