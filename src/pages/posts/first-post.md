# 🚀 Welcome to Astrosy!

Hi there! I’m Atakan, a computer-science major and astronomy enthusiast. This is the very first post on **Astrosy**, my little corner of the internet where I’ll share:

- **Deep-sky observations** 🪐  
- **Astrophotography tips** 📸  
- **Code & simulations** 🖥️  
- **News from space missions** 🚀

## Why I Started Astrosy

I’ve always been fascinated by the night sky—from staring up at stars as a kid to writing Python scripts that simulate X-ray halos around pulsars. Astrosy is where I’ll combine those passions: every post will blend **astronomy** with **code**, showing you not only _what_ is out there, but also _how_ to explore it yourself.

## What’s Coming Up

1. **Telescope Basics**: How to choose and set up your first scope.  
2. **Astrophotography Workflow**: From raw FITS files to Instagram-ready JPEGs.  
3. **Diffusion AI for Space Art**: My experiments using DDPMs to generate nebulae.  
4. **Code Walkthroughs**: Snippets and samples—think Jupyter notebooks you can clone.
