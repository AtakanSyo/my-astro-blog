import Countdown from '../../components/Countdown.astro';

The Quadrantids start the year with one of the sharpest, most intense meteor peaks. The 2026 burst arrives in the pre-dawn hours of **January 3**, favoring the Northern Hemisphere with potentially **60–120 meteors per hour** under dark skies.

## When and where to look

- **Peak window:** Brief and spiky, centered on the early hours of January 3 (UTC). Aim to observe between local midnight and dawn.  
- **Radiant:** Near the former constellation Quadrans Muralis, now in northern Boötes. Look generally northeast; meteors can appear anywhere across the sky.  
- **Moon phase:** A waning crescent keeps the sky relatively dark, improving contrast for faint meteors.  
- **Latitude advantage:** Mid- to high-northern latitudes get the best rates; southern observers will see fewer meteors due to the low radiant.

## Observing tips

1. **Go wide** — Use your unaided eyes. Binoculars and telescopes narrow the field and miss most trails.  
2. **Get dark adapted** — Spend 20–30 minutes away from white light; use red light for notes or gear.  
3. **Stay warm and patient** — Layers, a reclining chair, and a thermos keep you outside longer, which matters more than any single “perfect” minute.  
4. **Choose a dark site** — Escape city glow; even a short drive can double your visible meteor count.  
5. **Watch for fireballs** — Quadrantids occasionally produce bright, slow-burning streaks that leave short-lived trains.

## Quick facts

- **Parent body:** Likely asteroid 2003 EH1, possibly a dormant comet.  
- **Speed:** ~41 km/s entry velocity, producing quick, sharp streaks.  
- **Duration:** Active Dec 28–Jan 12, but peak is a narrow spike lasting only a few hours.  
- **Best posture:** Face up toward the darkest part of your sky with the radiant off to one side to catch longer trails.

## If clouds roll in

- Check satellite loops for breaks and be ready to move a short distance if safe.  
- Try audio meteor detection using FM radio reflections as an alternative observing method.  
- Note the peak time for your longitude and catch the tail end before dawn or the following night, when rates are lower but still present.

Clear skies and happy meteor hunting—may your first observing session of 2026 come with a flurry of Quadrantids.
