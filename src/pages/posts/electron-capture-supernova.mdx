    Electron-capture supernovae originate from stars with initial masses around 8–10 solar masses, perched between the
    white-dwarf and neutron-star fates. Their cores never reach the iron stage; instead, they build oxygen–neon–magnesium
    (O-Ne-Mg) mixtures supported by electron degeneracy pressure. As the core density approaches 10<sup>10</sup> g/cm³, electrons
    are captured by neon and magnesium nuclei, reducing pressure in a runaway cascade.

  <p>
    Once electron captures begin, the core can no longer resist gravity. It collapses in milliseconds, and an oxygen-deflagration
    front sweeps outward, leaving behind a nascent neutron star. Compared with massive core-collapse events, the explosion
    energy is modest—about 10<sup>50</sup> ergs—but still enough to eject the star’s outer envelope and seed space with fresh elements.

    Electron-capture supernovae likely explain the faint, rapidly evolving Type II-P events seen in nearby dwarf galaxies.
    Their light curves plateau for only a short time, and spectra often show narrow hydrogen lines from the extended envelope.
    Because the nickel-56 yield is low, the late-time luminosity fades quickly, distinguishing them from brighter Type II
    explosions.
  </p>

  <h3 id="why-we-care">Why we care</h3>
  <p>
    These explosions bridge the gap between end-of-life outcomes for intermediate-mass stars. They test our understanding
    of dense matter, electron-degenerate cores, and neutrino physics. Moreover, electron-capture events may explain the
    birth of some slow-moving neutron stars and the metallicity patterns in ancient clusters.
