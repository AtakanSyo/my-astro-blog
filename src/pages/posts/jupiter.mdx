<p>Jupiter was discovered by ancient civilizations in ancient times. 
	  However, first detailed observations of it were made 
	  by Galileo Galeli, in 1610, 
	  by a telescope made by Galileo himself.</p>

He laid out sketches of what he saw, 4 bright dots next to the large 
  brightness in the middle. These bright dots would later 
  come out to be the largest moons of Jupiter.

<p>Jupiter’s scale is almost overwhelming, its diameter 
  is about 143,000 km, more 
  than 11 times that of Earth, and its volume is so vast that over 
  1,300 Earths could fit 
  inside it.</p>

Jupiter hosts one of the largest storms ever observed by humanity.
Its size is so immense that it can engulf the entire Earth 
(about 16,000 km wide), larger than our planet’s diameter.

Jupiter has 95 known moons, making it the planet with the most 
satellites in our Solar System; among them are the four Galilean 
moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

  />
  <figcaption>Jupiter's 4 largest moons. Sizes and distances to scale.</figcaption>
</figure>

If the sizes of the moon and the distance between the planet 
were kept to scale, the moons would hardly be visible. This explains why
Galileo needed to build a telescope of his own to observe these moons.
