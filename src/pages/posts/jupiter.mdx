  <p class="Tool-Explanation">
    This simulation renders a shader-lit model of <strong>Jupiter</strong> with banded clouds, subtle limb darkening, and a faint starfield background.
    By default it runs on <strong>WebGL2 (Three.js)</strong> for broad compatibility. If your browser supports <strong>WebGPU</strong>, 
    you can enable it by adding <code>?gpu=1</code> to the URL for potentially smoother performance.

  <h2 id="about-this-page">About this page</h2>
  <p>
    Above is a <strong>GPU-accelerated Jupiter visualization</strong>. The scene includes a physically-lit sphere with 
    zonal bands (belts and zones), gentle limb darkening, and optional features like a persistent storm region resembling
    the Great Red Spot. A dim, inside-out sphere provides the starfield background.
  </p>

  <h3 id="what-youre-seeing">What you’re seeing</h3>
  <p>
    Jupiter rotates rapidly (sub-10-hour day), so the band patterns sweep by quickly. Light from a fixed “Sun” source 
    creates visible phases and shading across the cloud tops. The brownish belts and pale zones are stylized with 
    procedural noise to suggest turbulence and shear between jet streams.
  </p>

  <h2 id="tech-notes">Tech notes</h2>
  <p>
    In <strong>WebGL2</strong> mode, the visualization uses <em>MeshStandardMaterial</em> (PBR) with ACES tone mapping, sRGB textures (or
    procedural colors), and a small custom shader hook for band contrast. Limb darkening is approximated with a Fresnel-style 
    rim term. The starfield is a textured, back-faced sphere kept very dim to avoid distraction. If WebGPU is enabled, the loader
    will attempt that path; otherwise it falls back to WebGL2 automatically.
  </p>

  <h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
  <p>
    Works on all modern browsers supporting WebGL2. If WebGPU is enabled and available, the loader will attempt 
    to run that version; otherwise, it falls back to WebGL2 automatically.
  </p>

  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Is the Great Red Spot real here?</strong> It’s a stylized storm feature, not a physically accurate simulation, meant to hint at Jupiter’s famous anticyclone.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Is this physically exact?</strong> No — it’s a real-time visualization tuned for smooth performance and legibility rather than full atmospheric dynamics.
  </p>

  <h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
  <p>
    Based on real-time rendering techniques for planetary shaders, inspired by spacecraft imagery and amateur astrophotography.
