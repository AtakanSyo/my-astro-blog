<p>Jupiter was discovered by ancient civilizations in ancient times. 
  However, first detailed observations of it were made by Galileo Galeli, in 1610, 
  by a telescope made by Galileo himself.</p>

<p>Jupiter’s scale is almost overwhelming, its diameter is about 143,000 km, more 
  than 11 times that of Earth, and its volume is so vast that over 1,300 Earths could fit 
  inside it.</p>
