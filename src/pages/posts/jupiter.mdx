<p>Jupiter was discovered by ancient civilizations in ancient times. 
  However, first detailed observations of it were made by Galileo Galeli, in 1610, 
  by a telescope made by Galileo himself.</p>

<p>Jupiter’s scale is almost overwhelming, its diameter is about 143,000 km, more 
  than 11 times that of Earth, and its volume is so vast that over 1,300 Earths could fit 
  inside it.</p>

<p>Jupiter’s magnetic field is so enormous that, if it were visible, it would appear larger than the Sun in our sky. 
  It is the strongest planetary magnetic field in the Solar System—about 20,000 times more powerful than Earth’s. Jupiter’s 
  magnetosphere extends millions of kilometers into space and even reaches the orbit of Saturn on the 
  side facing the Sun.</p>

Jupiter hosts one of the largest storms ever observed by humanity.
Its size is so immense that it can engulf the entire Earth 
(about 16,000 km wide), larger than our planet’s diameter.

Jupiter has 95 known moons, making it the planet with the most 
satellites in our Solar System; among them are the four Galilean 
moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—each a world of its own, 
ranging from Io’s intense volcanism to Europa’s hidden ocean, 
while dozens of smaller, irregular moons orbit farther out, 
likely captured asteroids and comet fragments, giving Jupiter 
the character of a miniature solar system.
