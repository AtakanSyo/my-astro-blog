  <p>
    Above is a <strong>GPU-accelerated, real-time visualization of Jupiter</strong>, the largest planet in our Solar System. 
    Known for its swirling cloud bands, powerful jet streams, and iconic Great Red Spot, Jupiter is a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium. 
    This simulation is designed to give you a sense of the planet’s fast rotation, atmospheric patterns, and position against the deep backdrop of space.

  <h3 id="what-youre-seeing">What you’re seeing</h3>
  <p>
    Jupiter spins on its axis once every 9 hours and 56 minutes — so quickly that its equator bulges noticeably from the rapid rotation. 
    The brownish <em>belts</em> and pale <em>zones</em> in the simulation represent powerful winds moving in opposite directions at different latitudes, creating turbulence and storms. 
    One such storm, the <strong>Great Red Spot</strong>, has raged for at least 350 years and could fit Earth inside it. 
    While this model uses stylized noise patterns for performance, the overall band structure is based on real spacecraft imagery.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lighting in the simulation comes from a fixed “Sun” source, creating shadows and highlights that change as the planet rotates. 
    A subtle limb-darkening effect makes the edges appear softer and more realistic, as light scatters through the atmosphere. 
    The faint starfield in the background represents Jupiter’s position in the night sky.
  </p>

  <h2 id="observing-jupiter">Observing Jupiter</h2>
  <p>
    Jupiter is one of the brightest objects in the night sky and can be seen with the naked eye for most of the year. 
    Even a small telescope will reveal its cloud bands and the four largest moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto — first discovered by Galileo in 1610. 
    In fact, Jupiter’s moons change position night-to-night, and watching them orbit is one of the most rewarding beginner astronomy experiences.
  </p>

  <h2 id="tech-notes">Tech notes</h2>
  <p>
    The simulation runs in <strong>WebGL2</strong> by default, using physically based rendering (PBR) with ACES tone mapping and sRGB color correction. 
    A Fresnel-style rim term simulates limb darkening, while a textured, back-faced sphere provides the starfield. 
    On compatible systems, enabling WebGPU can offer smoother performance and higher visual fidelity. 
    This is not a scientific fluid-dynamics model but a lightweight real-time rendering designed for both beauty and accessibility.
