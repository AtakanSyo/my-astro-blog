  <p>
    Triple systems are wild: each star traces its own loop around a shared center of mass. This visualization staggers all three orbits with
    shifting radii and phases so you can watch them weave around the barycenter. A single planet remains bound to the primary star, carrying its
    dashed orbital path wherever the host goes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each sun carries its own point light and emissive glow, so the planet’s shading shifts as the stars swing by. A faint barycentric disc highlights
    the central reference point, and dashed rings show the distinct orbital radii for every body.
  </p>

  <h3 id="what-to-look-for">What to look for</h3>
  <p>
    Track how the planet’s ellipse moves with the primary star—pause when another sun passes nearby to imagine dramatic sky shows. Because each star
    uses a different orbital period and phase offset, conjunctions happen frequently; the paused state helps you study those alignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can tweak props to exaggerate the orbit radii, change colors, or even bind the planet to a different host star to explore other triple-star
    configurations.
  </p>

  <p>
    This scene reuses the shared SimStage + Three.js scaffold (ACES tone mapping, resize-aware orthographic camera, pause-aware animation loop).
    Stars are defined through keyed configs so each orbit radius, shift, and period can be overridden. Everything disposes cleanly on unmount,
    keeping GPU memory stable even if you flip between multiple simulations on the site.
