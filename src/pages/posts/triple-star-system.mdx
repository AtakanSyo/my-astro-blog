A faint barycentric disc highlights
the central reference point (center of mass), and dashed rings show the distinct orbital radii for every body.

<div class="sim-article">
  <p>
    Triple systems are wild: each star traces its own loop around a shared center of mass. 
    This visualization shows all three orbits with
    shifting radii and phases so you can watch them orbit around the barycenter (center of mass). 
    A single planet remains bound to the primary star, carrying its
    dashed orbital path wherever the host goes.
