  <p>
    Pair-instability supernovae erupt from stars initially weighing between roughly 140 and 260 solar masses.
    These titanically massive, metal-poor stars were common in the early cosmos, where cooling was inefficient and
    stellar nurseries assembled huge clumps at once. Their helium cores can exceed 60 solar masses, pushing central
    temperatures above one billion kelvin.

    When gamma-ray photons in the core gain enough energy, they spontaneously transform into electron–positron pairs.
    Radiation pressure plummets, the core contracts, and temperatures spike even higher. Oxygen and silicon ignite
    explosively, unleashing a thermonuclear runaway that outraces gravity itself. Unlike core-collapse events, there is
    no surviving remnant: the star is torn apart in a single pulse, ejecting tens of solar masses of material at high speed.

  <p>
    Pair-instability supernovae synthesize enormous amounts of radioactive nickel-56—sometimes more than ten solar masses.
    As nickel decays to cobalt and then iron, the light curve shines for months with a slow decline that betrays the
    radioactive power source. Because the ejecta mass is so high, diffusion times grow long, producing broad, plateau-like
    peaks that distinguish these explosions from ordinary Type II or Ia events.
  </p>

  <h3 id="cosmic-significance">Cosmic significance</h3>
  <p>
    Detecting pair-instability candidates helps astronomers probe Population III stars, the first stellar generation after
    the Big Bang. Their heavy-element yields—especially of oxygen, silicon, and sulfur—seeded the interstellar medium that
    later formed more familiar stars and planets. Surveys such as JWST’s deep fields and future Roman Space Telescope
    campaigns are poised to spot these rare flares in distant galaxies, revealing how the earliest chemical enrichment took place.
