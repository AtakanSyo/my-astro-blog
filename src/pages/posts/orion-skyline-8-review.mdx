<div class="highlight">
  The Orion SkyLine 8’s dual-speed focuser makes high-power focusing a breeze—
  it feels almost magical when you “snap” into perfect focus on Jupiter’s cloud bands.
</div>

The tube is short enough to fit across most car boots, making this scope
incredibly portable for its aperture…

<div class="tip">
  Tip: Use the included 35 mm extension tube whenever you switch eyepieces to
  avoid having to re-collimate.
