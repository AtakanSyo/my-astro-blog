  <p>
    Above is a <strong>GPU-accelerated, real-time visualization of the Sun</strong>, our G-type main-sequence star.
    The model emphasizes <em>photospheric granulation</em>, <strong>limb darkening</strong>, and a stylized hint of <em>magnetic activity</em> such as sunspots and faculae.
    It’s designed for clarity and performance rather than physical fluid simulation.
  </p>

  <h3 id="what-youre-seeing">What you’re seeing</h3>
  <p>
    The mottled texture evokes <strong>granulation</strong>: convection cells where hot plasma rises, cools, and sinks.
    Darker spots represent <strong>sunspots</strong>—regions of concentrated magnetic fields that appear cooler than their surroundings—while subtle bright rims suggest <em>faculae</em>.
    The disc edge appears dimmer due to <strong>limb darkening</strong>, modeled in the shader to approximate how light escapes from different depths in the photosphere.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sun exhibits <strong>differential rotation</strong>: roughly ~25 days at the equator and ~35 days near the poles.
    This visualization hints at that with latitude-dependent scrolling of the texture; it is a visual approximation, not a helioseismology-accurate model.
    A gentle additive glow stands in for the low-contrast <em>chromosphere/corona</em> for context.
  </p>

  <h2 id="observing-the-sun">Observing the Sun (Safety!)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Never look at the Sun directly or through optical instruments without a certified solar filter.</strong>
    With proper filters, you can see sunspots in white light. In <em>H-alpha</em>, narrowband filters reveal prominences and filaments along the limb.
    Solar activity varies over an ~11-year cycle, so the number and size of visible spots changes over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The simulation runs in <strong>WebGL2</strong> by default with ACES tone mapping and sRGB output.
    A multi-layer shader blends animated noise for granulation, a parametric limb-darkening curve, and optional spot masks with soft falloff.
    Latitude-weighted UV distortion suggests <em>differential rotation</em>. A back-faced sphere provides a faint starfield vignette (minimal for contrast).
    On compatible systems, enabling WebGPU can improve precision and frame pacing. This is a real-time educational rendering, not an MHD/CFD model.
