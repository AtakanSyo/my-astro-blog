  <h2 id="what-is-a-hypernova">What is a hypernova?</h2>
  <p>
    Hypernovae are extreme core-collapse supernovae born from stars with initial masses above ~25–30 solar masses
    that retain strong rotation and magnetic fields. As the iron core collapses, angular momentum funnels matter into
    an accretion disk feeding a nascent black hole. Magnetic dynamos tap the disk’s energy and drive collimated jets
    that punch through the stellar envelope, releasing energies up to ten times that of ordinary supernovae.
  </p>

  <h3 id="jets-and-gamma-rays">Jets and gamma rays</h3>
  <p>
    When the jet axis aligns with our line of sight, we detect the event as a long-duration gamma-ray burst.
    Internal shocks within the jet accelerate electrons to relativistic speeds, and synchrotron radiation floods
    the spectrum from gamma rays down to radio afterglows. Even when the jets are off-axis, the cocoon of shocked
    gas they inflate leaves a distinctive imprint: bipolar lobes, high-velocity knots, and broad-lined spectral
    features from iron-group elements.
  </p>

  <h3 id="chemical-yields">Chemical yields</h3>
  <p>
    Hypernovae are efficient factories for heavy elements. Their immense explosion energies synthesize large quantities
    of nickel-56, cobalt, and zinc, enriching the interstellar medium far beyond what standard Type II events produce.
    Observing their remnants helps explain the elevated abundances of these elements in ancient, metal-poor stars that
    formed shortly after the first galaxies assembled.
  </p>

  <h3 id="why-hypernovae-matter">Why hypernovae matter</h3>
  <p>
    Hypernovae link many frontier questions in astrophysics: the origin of gamma-ray bursts, the birth of rapidly spinning
    black holes, and the chemical evolution of the early universe. Their blinding luminosity allows us to trace star formation
    in galaxies billions of light-years away, providing time capsules from epochs when the cosmos was young and metal-poor.
