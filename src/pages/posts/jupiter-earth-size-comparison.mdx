  <h2 id="about-this-simulation">About this simulation</h2>
  <p>
    This interactive scene places Jupiter and Earth side by side so you can see their vast difference in scale.
    The sizes are based on real measurements: Jupiter’s mean radius is about 71,500 kilometers, while Earth’s is just 6,371 kilometers.
    That means Jupiter is more than eleven times wider. When you take volume into account, the gap becomes even greater,
    with Jupiter holding over 1,300 times the volume of Earth.

  <h2 id="why-it-matters">Why this is interesting</h2>
  <p>
    Seeing Earth next to Jupiter reveals just how enormous the largest planet in our Solar System really is.
    Jupiter’s gravity and sheer size have shaped the Solar System’s architecture, influencing asteroid orbits and even protecting
    Earth by deflecting or capturing comets and other debris. The comparison highlights the extraordinary diversity of planets
    in our cosmic neighborhood.
