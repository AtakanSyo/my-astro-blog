  <p>
    Above is a <strong>GPU-accelerated, real-time visualization of Saturn</strong>, the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our Solar System.
    The simulation features realistic gas giant banding, subtle atmospheric scattering, and the planet’s iconic ring system rendered with accurate proportions and transparency effects.

  <h3 id="what-youre-seeing">What you’re seeing</h3>
  <p>
    Saturn is best known for its spectacular rings, composed mostly of ice particles with some rocky debris and dust.
    The planet itself is a gas giant made primarily of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface.
    This visualization simulates differential rotation in its atmosphere and the natural color variations caused by ammonia clouds and trace elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ring system is shown with scientifically accurate inner and outer radii, and a realistic density gradient.
    The lighting comes from a fixed Sun position, casting shadows of the rings onto the planet and vice versa.
    Subtle atmospheric scattering at the limb adds depth and realism to the visual.

  <h2 id="observing-saturn">Observing Saturn</h2>
  <p>
    Saturn is one of the most captivating sights in the night sky.
    Even a small telescope reveals its rings and the dark Cassini Division.
    Larger instruments can show additional ring details and Saturn’s largest moon, Titan.
    The best viewing occurs when Saturn is at opposition, fully illuminated by the Sun and closest to Earth.
  </p>

  <p>
    This visualization runs in <strong>WebGL2</strong> by default, using physically based rendering (PBR) and ACES tone mapping.
    Procedural shaders create the banded atmosphere and ring textures, while the simulation dynamically adjusts lighting and shadowing for realistic interaction between the planet and its rings.
    On compatible browsers, enabling WebGPU can improve shading precision and frame rate.
    While designed for educational purposes, the model is based on NASA imagery and known planetary dimensions.
