  <h2 id="core-collapse-at-a-glance">Core collapse at a glance</h2>
  <p>
    Type II supernovae mark the violent deaths of massive stars. Once an iron core approaches the
    Chandrasekhar mass, pressure from degenerate electrons collapses, gravity wins, and the core implodes
    in milliseconds. A rebound shock races outward through the infalling layers, dragging neutrino-heated
    bubbles and magnetic turbulence that seed clumps, jets, and knots in the debris.
  </p>

  <h3 id="layers-of-the-star">Layers of the star</h3>
  <p>
    Before collapse, the progenitor’s onion-like shells fuse progressively heavier elements. Hydrogen and helium
    dominate the outer envelope, while silicon and sulfur live just above the inert iron heart. When the shock breaks
    through, each layer imprints its chemistry on the ejecta: hydrogen Balmer lines dominate the early spectra,
    calcium and oxygen lines bloom weeks later, and radioactive nickel-56 powers the fading light curve.
  </p>

  <h3 id="fates-of-the-core">Fates of the core</h3>
  <p>
    The collapsed center survives. If the remnant mass stays below about 2.2 solar masses, neutron degeneracy pressure
    halts the collapse and a neutron star emerges—often spinning rapidly and emitting pulsar beacons. More massive cores
    continue inward to form black holes. Either way, the newborn object launches relativistic winds that sculpt the
    inner ejecta, driving the asymmetries hinted at in the expanding shell.
  </p>

  <h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
  <p>
    Type II explosions forge and disperse many of the heavy elements that end up in planets and life. They also seed
    star-forming regions with shocks, cosmic rays, and enriched gas. Observatories such as the Vera Rubin Observatory
    and JWST chase their light curves to understand neutrino physics, nuclear burning, and the birth statistics of
    neutron stars. Each flare is a laboratory for extreme matter, far beyond anything achievable on Earth.
