  A calm, top-down view of our Solar System. Tap play, watch the planets glide, and imagine you are floating high above the ecliptic.

  <h2 id="welcome">Welcome to the neighborhood</h2>
  <p>
    Imagine hovering hundreds of millions of kilometres above the Sun, looking straight down on the entire Solar System. That is the
    feeling this simulation aims to deliver. Planets sweep gracefully around the Sun, each carrying a genuine surface texture taken from
    space-mission imagery. The distances are artistically compressed so you can see every world at once, yet the <strong>tempo of the
    orbits</strong> stays faithful to real astronomy data: Mercury loops in weeks, Earth keeps its steady one-year rhythm, and Neptune
    barely budges.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use the pause button whenever you want to freeze a moment. The simulation defaults to an easy pace, but if you are curious you can
    tweak the component’s <code>options.daysPerSecond</code> value in code to speed up or slow down the dance. The textures are loaded
    from the <code>public/textures</code> folder, so dropping in a new map for your favourite planet is as simple as swapping a file.
  </p>

  <h2 id="lighting-and-shadows">Lighting, shadows, and ambience</h2>
  <p>
    The Sun at the centre is not just a bright decoration. A physically based point light lives inside it, casting illumination across
    every planet. You can easily spot the dividing line between day and night (the terminator), and the thin ambient fill softens the
    shadowed hemispheres just enough to keep surface details visible. The orbit traces are rendered as translucent white rings against a
    black backdrop so that the geometry of the system stays clear without stealing attention from the worlds themselves.
  </p>

  <h2 id="what-to-look-for">What to look for</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Mercury</strong> hugs the Sun tightly, racing through its orbit in just 88 days. <strong>Venus</strong> appears serene but
    remember that it spins backward (a retrograde rotation). <strong>Earth</strong> and <strong>Mars</strong> show off familiar desert
    and oceanic textures, while the gas giants glow with belts, storms, and subtle cloud bands. Out beyond Saturn’s orbit sit
    <strong>Uranus</strong> and <strong>Neptune</strong>, their cool blues moving so slowly that you could step away for a cup of tea and
    return to find them barely shifted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because this is a simplified orrery, the planets all share the same radius by default (half the size of the Sun in the current
    build). That makes it easier to read the scene and recognise each texture. If you are after strict scale, you can pass a custom
    <code>planetRadius</code> or even rescale individual worlds inside the component.
  </p>
