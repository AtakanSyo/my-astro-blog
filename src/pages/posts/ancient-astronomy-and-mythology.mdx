<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>
How did Vikings find their way in vast oceans? How did Egyptians predict when the River Nile would flood?
How did Greeks calculate the size of the Earth 2,000 years ago? <strong>Answer: the stars.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Ancient civilizations lived under skies far darker than most of us ever see today. If you’d been alive in the time of
pharaohs or philosophers, you would’ve regularly stood beneath a dome of brilliant starlight. It’s no surprise, then,
that the ancients <em>studied</em> the stars, <em>used</em> them for navigation and calendars, and often <em>divinized</em> them.

<h3>Stars Change in Time</h3>

<p>
The star patterns we see today aren’t quite the same as those seen by ancient peoples thousands of years ago.
That’s because of <strong>axial precession</strong>—a slow wobble of Earth’s rotation axis over a 26,000-year cycle.
</p>

<p>
Today, Polaris is our North Star. It’s famous for always indicating true north, guiding explorers like
Christopher Columbus (1451–1506), Ferdinand Magellan (1480–1521), and Marco Polo (1254–1324). But if you travelled
back several millennia, Polaris would not be in that position. Around 2600 BCE, the star <strong>Thuban</strong> in the constellation Draco
occupied the role of the North Star—a fact reflected in ancient monuments like the Great Pyramid.
</p>

<h3>Using the Stars</h3>

<h4>Ancient Egypt: Calendars and Architecture</h4>

<p>
By 4000 BCE, Egyptians were already tracking the night sky. At Nabta Playa, a stone circle aligned with certain
stars acted as a calendar, allowing accurate prediction of seasonal events.
</p>

<p>
By 3000–2000 BCE, they’d refined a <strong>365-day calendar</strong> to predict the annual flooding of the Nile—critical for agriculture.
Their engineering achievements also extended to stellar alignment: the Pyramids of Giza are precisely oriented to
the cardinal directions.
</p>

<p>
In the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid, narrow shafts (often called air vents) point directly toward Thuban—the North Star of the time.
This was likely intentional, ensuring the pharaoh could “look” upon the star in the afterlife.

<h3>The Orion Belt and the Pyramids</h3>

<p>
In 1995, Robert Bauval proposed the <strong>Orion Correlation Theory</strong>: that the three main pyramids at Giza align with
the stars in Orion’s Belt. The nearby Milky Way would then correspond to the River Nile, creating a cosmic map on Earth.
</p>

<p>
However, skeptics point out that the Nile’s course has shifted over millennia. The alignment could be coincidental
or aimed at pleasing the view from the riverbanks. Derek Hitchins has argued against the theory in detail.
It’s possible both interpretations hold truth—the pyramids could have been aligned for both stellar and terrestrial reasons.
</p>

<h3>King of Alexandria</h3>

<p>
During the Eastern Roman period, astronomy was taught alongside mathematics and philosophy. The most famous figure of ancient astronomy,
<strong>Ptolemy</strong> (c. 100–170 CE), lived in Alexandria, then the largest city in the Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
In Alexandria, he wrote the <strong>Almagest</strong>, a comprehensive astronomy treatise that became the standard reference for over a thousand years.
It was first translated into Arabic, then into Latin, Greek, French, German, and eventually nearly every language of learning in Europe.
Ptolemy became known as the “King of Alexandria” among scholars.
</p>

<p>
Ptolemy’s model was <strong>geocentric</strong>: the Earth at the center, with the Moon, Sun, planets, and stars revolving around it.
He cataloged 1,022 stars and explained planetary motions using <em>epicycles</em>—small circles traced by planets as they moved along larger orbits.

<h3>Greek Mythology and Astronomy</h3>

<p>
Many constellations’ names today trace back to Ancient Greece. Even the planets’ names, though Roman in form,
come from Greek gods and myths (e.g., Mars = Ares, Neptune = Poseidon, Venus = Aphrodite).
</p>

<p>
Greek poets <strong>Homer</strong> and <strong>Hesiod</strong> embedded constellations into epic stories. In Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>, Orion appears on
Achilles’ shield. Orion himself was said to be a mighty hunter whose arrogance angered Gaia, the titan of nature.
She sent the giant scorpion <strong>Scorpius</strong> to kill him. Zeus immortalized both in the sky, where Scorpius eternally
chases Orion.

<h3>Stars: A Bridge Between the Ancient and Modern</h3>

<p>
Stars link us to the countless generations who came before. They are a bridge of time and imagination.
The next time you stand under a starry sky, remember that ancient eyes once looked upon the same lights,
wondering about the mysteries they hold—just as we do today.
