<h2>When Is the Next Full Moon?</h2>

The next full moon rises on **Wednesday, November 5, 2025**, with peak illumination at **8:19 a.m. EST (13:19 UTC)**. Even if daylight hides the exact moment where you live, the lunar disc will appear full the night before and the night after—perfect for casual skywatching or a neighborhood sidewalk session.


<hr />

<h3>Observing Tip (Great for Beginners)</h3>

Most newcomers reach for the eyepiece during the full moon, but that is the toughest time to see crisp surface relief. With the Sun shining straight on, shadows disappear, washing out crater rims and mountain ridges. For razor-sharp detail, plan a session a few days before or after the full phase, when sunlight grazes the terminator at an angle and carves dramatic contrast across the surface.

✅ The full moon still delivers for **lunar photography** and wide-field shots—especially if you want the Moon framed with cityscapes or foreground silhouettes.

<h2>Why Full Moons Have Names</h2>

Many of the Moon names familiar in North America trace back to Native American and early Colonial farming cycles. They are practical labels that describe what is happening on the ground:

<InfoCardGrid
  cards={[
    {
      title: 'Harvest Moon',
      body: 'Extra moonlight gives farmers precious evening hours to collect crops.',
      tone: 'muted',
    },
    {
      title: 'Cold Moon',
      body: 'Signals winter’s arrival as temperatures slide.',
      tone: 'muted',
    },
    {
      title: 'Strawberry Moon',
      body: 'Marks the start of berry season.',
      tone: 'muted',
    },
  ]}
/>

Every culture has its own lunar naming tradition—Chinese, Celtic, Hindu, and more—showing just how universal the Moon’s monthly rhythm is in human history.

<h2>How Moon Phases Work</h2>

The Moon does not produce its own light; we see sunlight reflected off the lunar surface. As the Moon orbits Earth, we see different fractions of its sunlit half.

    },
    {
      title: 'Waning Gibbous',
      description: 'Brightness recedes as the Moon angles away.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Third Quarter',
      description: 'Left half is lit (Northern Hemisphere view).',
    },
    {
      title: 'Waning Crescent',
      description: 'A final sliver before the cycle restarts at new moon.',
    },
  ]}
/>

Fun fact: the Moon always shows the same hemisphere because of **tidal locking**, a gravitational tug-of-war that matched its rotation period to its orbital period.

<h2>Eclipses in 2025</h2>

Full moons are the only time we can experience **lunar eclipses**, when Earth’s shadow sweeps across the Moon. New moons are required for **solar eclipses**, when the Moon briefly blocks the Sun.
