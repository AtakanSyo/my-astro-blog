<p class="highlight">Different eyepieces change how much sky you see and how bright objects appear. Enter your setup, and this calculator shows the magnification, true field of view, and exit pupil — 
  the three numbers that define your visual observing experience.</p>

<h2>Magnification</h2>
<p>Magnification tells you how many times larger an object appears through the telescope compared to the naked eye.
It is calculated by dividing the telescope’s focal length by the eyepiece focal length.
Higher magnification doesn’t always mean a better view — too much magnification makes the image dim and blurry,
and is limited by atmospheric seeing conditions.</p>

<h2>True Field of View (TFOV)</h2>
<p>True Field of View is how much of the sky you can see through the eyepiece, measured in degrees.
A TFOV of 1° means you can see an area of sky about twice the width of the full Moon.
Wide TFOV eyepieces are excellent for star clusters, nebulae, and sweeping across the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Exit Pupil</h2>
<p>Exit pupil represents the diameter of the beam of light leaving the eyepiece and entering your eye.
It determines how bright and comfortable the view looks. Larger exit pupils (4–6 mm) are great for deep-sky objects.
Smaller exit pupils (smaller than 1 mm) are best for Lunar and planetary viewing - sharper but dimmer. </p>
