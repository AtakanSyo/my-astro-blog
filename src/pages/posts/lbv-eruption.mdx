  <p>
    Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are among the most massive, luminous stars known—objects like Eta Carinae and P Cygni.
    They hover dangerously close to the Eddington limit, where radiation pressure rivals gravity. Small instabilities in
    their envelopes can trigger violent outbursts that eject several solar masses of gas and dust in just a few years.

  <h3 id="giant-eruption-physics">Giant eruption physics</h3>
  <p>
    During a giant eruption, the star’s outer layers become opaque and expand dramatically, cooling from tens of thousands
    of kelvin down to just a few thousand. Deep beneath the photosphere, turbulent convection and possible binary
    interactions shake loose entire shells of material. Unlike a true supernova, the core survives, but the energy release
    rivals that of smaller stellar explosions.
  </p>

  <h3 id="shaping-nebulae">Shaping nebulae</h3>
  <p>
    LBVs sculpt iconic bipolar nebulae. The Homunculus around Eta Carinae formed in the 1840s eruption and now expands at
    hundreds of kilometers per second, glowing in reflected starlight and infrared dust emission. These nebulae provide
    time capsules of the star’s history, preserving latitude-dependent mass loss and clues about companion stars.

  <h3 id="why-lbvs-matter">Why LBVs matter</h3>
  <p>
    LBV eruptions may set the stage for future supernovae by stripping hydrogen envelopes and injecting chemically enriched
    gas into the interstellar medium. They also serve as laboratories for super-Eddington winds, magnetic eruptions, and
    binary mass transfer. Observations across the electromagnetic spectrum—especially with JWST and ALMA—continue to reveal
    how these unstable titans influence their host galaxies.
