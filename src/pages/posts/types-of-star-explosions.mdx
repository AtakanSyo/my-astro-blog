  <p>
    Hit play to watch thousands of embers rocket away from the center. Each particle follows the velocity law of a stellar outburst—Type Ia,
    hypernova, kilonova, and more—so the expansion profile changes dramatically depending on the scenario you select. The glow never flickers
    or respawns; it simply coasts outward as the physics dials dictate.

  <p>
    Set the <code>explosionType</code> prop to swap between astrophysical models: <code>typeIa</code>, <code>typeII</code>, <code>hypernova</code>,
    <code>pairInstability</code>, <code>electronCapture</code>, <code>lbv</code>, and <code>kilonova</code>. The helper automatically samples the
    right initial speeds (drawn from the distributions above) and integrates the matching velocity curves, so all you change is the name.
    Life span, particle count, and color remain tweakable for artistic flair or heavier math experiments.

  <h3 id="explosion-profiles">Explosion profiles</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Type Ia supernova.</strong> A white dwarf detonates after stealing enough mass from a companion star. The thermonuclear burn sweeps through the whole star almost uniformly, so material races outward at nearly constant speed. In the sim that means a smooth, spherical plume with little variation from one particle to the next.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Type II supernova.</strong> When a massive star collapses, its outer layers get flung outward; the outermost shells move fastest while the inner material lags. We mimic that homologous expansion by assigning speed according to each particle’s starting radius, producing a layered wave where outer debris surges ahead.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Hypernova / long gamma-ray burst.</strong> Jets punch through the poles at nearly relativistic speeds, while the equatorial direction expands more modestly. In the helper we blend a steep cosine power into the initial velocity, so particles near the jet axis leap ahead and the rest trail behind, all while drag gradually reins in the flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pair-instability supernova.</strong> Ultra-massive stars can detonate completely when gamma rays create electron–positron pairs, removing pressure support. The explosion starts with an enormous shove but relaxes into free expansion. The velocity law eases in—fast at the start, then drifting—yielding a dramatic early flare that coasts over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Electron-capture supernova.</strong> Intermediate stars collapse when electrons get captured by atomic nuclei, weakening support from the core. The blast is weaker and quickly damped: velocities decay exponentially, so the cloud races out briefly then slows to a halt, matching observations of these less-energetic events.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>LBV giant eruption.</strong> Luminous blue variables like Eta Carinae undergo violent but non-terminal outbursts. Dense winds drag on the ejecta, so the velocity falls off as <code>1/(1 + βt)</code>. In the visualization, particles get a gentle initial kick and then slog outward, producing a thick, slow-moving nebula.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Kilonova.</strong> Neutron-star mergers fling neutron-rich debris at a significant fraction of light speed, but interaction with surrounding material and neutrino winds slows it down. Our model launches particles at 0.1–0.3c and applies an exponential drag term, showing a torus-like outflow that brightens quickly and then drifts.
