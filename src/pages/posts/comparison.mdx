  <h2 id="about-this-simulation">About this simulation</h2>
  <p>
    This interactive scene places Jupiter and Neptune side by side so you can see their true difference in scale.
    The sizes are based on real measurements: Jupiter’s radius is around 71,500 kilometers, while Neptune’s is about 24,600 kilometers.
    That means Jupiter is nearly three times wider. When you take volume into account, the gap grows even larger, with Jupiter holding roughly twenty-four times more space than Neptune.

  <h2 id="why-it-matters">Why this is interesting</h2>
  <p>
    Seeing these two worlds together highlights just how dominant Jupiter is in our Solar System.
    Even though Neptune is called a “giant planet,” it looks modest when placed next to Jupiter.
    Jupiter’s enormous size affects the orbits of other planets, shapes the asteroid belt, and even protects Earth by pulling in comets and other debris.
