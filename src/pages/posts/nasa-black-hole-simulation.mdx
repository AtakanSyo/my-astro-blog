<section>
  <p>
    This new ultra-high definition simulation shows three orbits of a pair of <strong>supermassive black holes</strong> only forty
    orbits from merging. It reveals how matter behaves in one of the universe’s most extreme environments, where gravity sculpts
    streams of gas into glowing disks and high-energy light escapes from regions close to the event horizon.

  <h2>Inside the Simulation</h2>
  <p>
    The system modeled here has a mass of about <em>one million Suns</em> and a separation of <em>30 million kilometers</em>
    between the two black holes. Three regions of light-emitting gas shine as they orbit:
    the large <strong>circumbinary disk</strong> surrounding both black holes,
    and two smaller <strong>mini disks</strong> feeding each one individually.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of these structures emit predominantly ultraviolet light. When gas flows rapidly into a mini disk,
    the intense UV interacts with the black hole’s <strong>corona</strong>—a halo of energetic particles—producing bursts of X-rays.
    When the accretion rate slows, UV light dims and the relative X-ray brightness increases.

  <h2>The Computational Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    To create this simulation, scientists used the <strong>Blue Waters supercomputer</strong> at the University of Illinois at
    Urbana-Champaign. Modeling just three orbits of this system required <em>46 continuous days</em> on
    <em>9,600 processing cores</em>. Such calculations are essential for predicting what astronomers might one day observe
    when telescopes detect electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave signals from merging black holes.

  <h2>Reflections</h2>
  <p>
    Simulations like this bridge theory and observation. They transform abstract equations of relativity and fluid dynamics
    into moving pictures of the cosmos in action. Watching two black holes spiral toward collision reminds us that the
    universe is not static, but alive with processes on unimaginable scales. Each orbit brings us closer to understanding
    how galaxies evolve and how the most massive objects in the universe shape their surroundings.
