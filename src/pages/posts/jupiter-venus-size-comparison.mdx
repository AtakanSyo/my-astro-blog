<figcaption class="sim-caption">
  Jupiter and Venus rendered to scale. Jupiter’s mean radius is ~69,911 km, while Venus’s is ~6,052 km—making Jupiter more than eleven times wider, and over 1,500 times greater in volume.

  <h2 id="about-this-simulation">About this Simulation</h2>
  <p>
    This interactive comparison places Jupiter and Venus side by side at their true scales. 
    At first glance, the difference is overwhelming: Venus, nearly Earth’s twin in size, shrinks to 
    a small glowing sphere beside the immense bulk of Jupiter. The radii used are the most widely 
    accepted values—69,911 km for Jupiter and 6,052 km for Venus. The result is a diameter ratio 
    of about 11.6 to 1, but because volume grows with the cube of radius, Jupiter’s interior could 
    contain more than 1,500 Venuses.

  <h3 id="mass-and-density">Mass and Density</h3>
  <p>
    Jupiter is the heavyweight of our Solar System, with a mass of 1.898 × 10²⁷ kilograms. 
    Venus, in contrast, weighs in at 4.867 × 10²⁴ kilograms. That’s almost 400 times less. 
    Yet the densities tell a different story: Venus is rocky and compact, averaging about 
    5.2 g/cm³, while Jupiter, made mostly of hydrogen and helium, is far less dense at 
    only 1.3 g/cm³. This explains why Jupiter’s size and mass are so disproportionate—it 
    is a vast sphere of light gases held together by enormous gravity.
  </p>

  <h3 id="gravity-and-surface-experience">Gravity and Surface Experience</h3>
  <p>
    If you could stand at the top of Jupiter’s cloud deck, you would feel a pull nearly 
    three times stronger than on Venus. Jupiter’s effective surface gravity is about 24.8 m/s², 
    while Venus’s is 8.87 m/s²—remarkably close to Earth’s. This similarity in surface 
    conditions once made Venus seem like a candidate for life. But appearances are deceiving.

  <h3 id="jupiter-s-cloud-bands">Jupiter’s Cloud Bands</h3>
  <p>
    Jupiter’s visible “surface” is really a tapestry of clouds. Bands of light and dark 
    material sweep across the planet, driven by rapid rotation and complex jet streams. 
    The Great Red Spot, a storm larger than Earth itself, has raged for centuries and is 
    a defining mark on its face.
  </p>

  <h3 id="venus-s-opaque-atmosphere">Venus’s Opaque Atmosphere</h3>
  <p>
    Venus could not look more different. Shrouded in a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide, 
    it reflects sunlight brilliantly but hides its surface from view in visible light. 
    Space probes and radar imaging reveal volcanic plains, mountains, and craters beneath 
    the cloud cover. Temperatures soar above 460°C, hot enough to melt lead, making Venus 
    the hottest planet in the Solar System despite being further from the Sun than Mercury.
  </p>

  <h2 id="perspective-and-scale">Perspective and Scale</h2>
  <p>
    This simulation is intentionally stark. Venus, impressive in its own right as nearly 
    Earth-sized, is reduced to a bright dot beside the largest planet in our system. The 
    effect drives home how varied our planetary neighbors are. By zooming in and out, 
    you can shift your sense of perspective: Venus may feel comfortably familiar when 
    viewed alone, but next to Jupiter it becomes a reminder of the staggering diversity 
    of worlds orbiting the Sun.
