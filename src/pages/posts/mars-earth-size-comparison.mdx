<h2>How big are Earth and Mars, really?</h2>

When the two planets appear in movies or graphics, Mars is usually shown as a slightly smaller twin of Earth. Once you place them at true scale, the illusion collapses. Earth’s mean radius is 6,371 kilometers. Mars’s radius is just 3,390 kilometers — almost exactly half. Halving the radius does not mean “half the size,” though, because volume increases with the cube of radius. Thanks to that cubic relationship, Earth has more than six times the volume of Mars. If Earth were hollow, you could place six Mars-sized spheres inside it and still have room left over.

<h2>Mass and gravity</h2>

The mass difference is even more striking than the size difference. Earth has a mass of 5.97 × 10²⁴ kilograms. Mars has 6.39 × 10²³ kilograms — only about ten percent of Earth’s mass. Mass controls surface gravity, and you feel that difference instantly. On Earth, the surface gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared. On Mars, it is 3.7. A person weighing 70 kilograms on Earth would weigh around 26 kilograms on Mars. Everyday movements feel exaggerated, almost like slow motion, not because of reduced air resistance but because gravity simply has less authority there.

<h2>What the planets are made of</h2>

Both are rocky worlds, but their interiors evolved differently. Earth has a solid iron core wrapped in a molten outer core. That churning metal creates Earth’s magnetic field, which protects the atmosphere and helps maintain conditions suitable for liquid water and life. Above the mantle, Earth’s tectonic plates shift, collide, recycle rock, and continually shape the surface.

Mars also formed with an iron-rich core, but the planet is so much smaller that it cooled rapidly. The magnetic field faded. Without that protection, the atmosphere slowly escaped to space. Today the surface is coated in iron oxide — rust — giving Mars its deep red color. Geologically, Mars is quiet, but not boring. It hosts Olympus Mons, a volcano about 22 kilometers tall, and Valles Marineris, a canyon system wider than the United States.

<h2>The size surprise</h2>

Most people assume Mars is “a bit smaller than Earth,” something like a compact version of home. Seeing them side by side reveals the truth: Earth feels like a world; Mars feels like a worldlet. Its smaller radius led to lower mass, and the low mass led to weaker gravity. The weak gravity meant the atmosphere couldn’t stay thick, and without a thick atmosphere, Mars couldn’t hold onto liquid water on its surface. A chain reaction of consequences — all because the planet is small.

Mars is Earth-like in terrain, in seasons, and in mystery. But when it comes to size, mass, and power, the difference is enormous.
