  Two suns orbit the system barycenter on offset loops—one shifted left, the other right—while a lone planet clings to the golden primary.

  <h2 id="about-this-simulation">About this simulation</h2>
  <p>
    S-type systems keep their planets bound to just one star even though a stellar companion is nearby. Here, both stars orbit a shared barycenter:
    the golden primary traces a loop nudged to the right, the blue companion mirrors it on the left, and a single planet rides along with the primary
    on a slightly eccentric ellipse. Use the pause control to inspect alignments or resume to watch the binary dance unfold.
  </p>
  <p>
    Point lights tied to each star produce the shading you see on the planet and stars, while a faint ambient fill keeps the nightside visible without
    overpowering the binary lighting. Dashed orbital guides make it easy to track which body orbits which.
  </p>

  <h3 id="what-to-look-for">What to look for</h3>
  <p>
    Notice how each stellar orbit is shifted to opposite sides of the origin, making the barycenter easy to read. The planet’s dashed path stays glued
    to the moving primary, so you always know which star it truly orbits. Pause when the companion sweeps behind the primary to imagine dramatic
    double-sunset skies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the component exposes radii, intensities, and orbital periods through props, you can recreate specific discoveries like Kepler-444 or craft your
    own story-driven binary with custom colors.
