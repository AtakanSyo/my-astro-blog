<h2>What the simulation shows</h2>
<p>This visualization places Saturn next to Jupiter using their real physical diameters and true 3D geometry. Jupiter appears as a massive, turbulent atmosphere with deeply colored storm bands, while Saturn presents a smoother golden appearance. Saturn’s rings are intentionally not included in the diameter comparison to keep the measurement planet-to-planet. When seen side by side, Saturn looks large by itself, but Jupiter makes it feel almost modest in scale. The simulation captures this difference without exaggeration or artistic distortion.</p>

<h2>The numbers behind the scale</h2>
<p>Saturn’s diameter is approximately 120,536 km. Jupiter’s diameter is about 139,820 km. The diameter ratio between them is:</p>

$$
\frac{D_J}{D_S} = \frac{139{,}820}{120{,}536} \approx 1.16
$$

<p>Volume scales with the cube of the diameter:</p>

$$
(1.16)^3 \approx 1.56
$$

<p>This means Jupiter has about one and a half times the volume of Saturn. Surface area, which determines how large the visible planetary face appears, scales with the square of the diameter:</p>

$$
(1.16)^2 \approx 1.35
$$

<p>So Jupiter’s visible disk is roughly 35% larger than Saturn’s. With both rendered at true scale in 3D space, the simulation makes the size difference intuitive at a glance, revealing why Jupiter is often called the king of the planets.</p>
