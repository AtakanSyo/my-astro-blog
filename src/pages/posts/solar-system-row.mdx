  Every planet spins in order from Mercury through Neptune, scaled by true radii so their proportions read at a glance.

<h2 id="about-this-lineup">The Solar System Lineup</h2>
<p>
  All eight major planets stand shoulder-to-shoulder from left to right: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
  Their diameters are scaled relative to one another, so the tiny rocky worlds crowd together while the gas and ice giants dominate the lineup.
  A gentle rotation lets every world show off its best face without distracting from the overall comparison.
</p>
<p>
  The single-file arrangement makes it easy to trace the classic sequence we learn in school and appreciate how dramatically the outer planets
  outsize their inner neighbors. Pause the animation whenever you want to study cloud bands, storm systems, or subtle color changes.
</p>

<h3 id="what-to-notice">What to notice</h3>
<p>
  Mercury and Mars appear almost lost beside Earth, yet still show distinct color palettes. Jupiter and Saturn crowd the middle with belts,
  zones, and hints of ring structure, while Uranus and Neptune close the row with cooler hues. Watch for the slow, retrograde spin of Venus
  and Uranus compared to the quick rotation of Jupiter.
</p>

<p>
  This gallery-style view favors a straight comparison. Need a mnemonic refresher? Follow the row from the sun-scorched face of Mercury all the way
  to distant Neptune. Each globe keeps spinning so you can pick out landmarks like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot or the contrasting north and south poles of Earth.
