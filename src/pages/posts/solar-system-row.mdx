  Every planet spins in order from Mercury through Neptune, scaled by true radii so their proportions read at a glance.

  <p>
    This lineup keeps the Solar System simple: all eight planets sit on a single axis, each spinning at its own rate while a soft rim light
    highlights the curvature. Radii follow real-world proportions—scaled to fit the frame—so you instantly see how giant Jupiter and Saturn are
    compared to the rocky inner worlds.
  </p>
  <p>
    The scene is powered by our reusable Three.js helpers, so each planet reuses the same setup code. Swap a texture, adjust spacing, or add labels
    without touching low-level renderer logic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Start the animation to compare spin speeds: Jupiter whips around fastest, Venus and Uranus drift slowly with their retrograde rotation.
    Pause the sim and drag the window wider to appreciate how resize-aware rendering keeps each world crisp regardless of viewport.
  </p>

  <p>
    Planets are placed using relative Earth radii scaled by <code>sizeScale</code>. Lighting mixes ambient, forward, and rim sources for readable shading.
    Each globe is generated by <code>addSpinningPlanet</code>, which handles texture loading, anisotropy, and cleanup behind the scenes.
