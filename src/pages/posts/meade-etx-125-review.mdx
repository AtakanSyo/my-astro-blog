<p class="highlight">The Meade ETX 125 is a huge step up from the ETX 80 and ETX 90 in build quality and performance, but the price jump leaves it in an awkward spot among stronger competitors.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>

<p>Meade addressed the two biggest flaws of the cheaper ETX models—plastic drive gears and a flimsy aluminium tripod—by outfitting the ETX 125 with metal motors and a steel-legged support. The result is a notably quieter, sturdier single-arm GoTo mount that inspires more confidence than its predecessors. Unfortunately, those upgrades push the price to around $700, more than double the cost of the ETX 80.</p>

<p>For observers with ready access to Meade service and the patience to hunt down a discount, the ETX 125 can be a tempting portable planet hunter. At full price, however, it is difficult to recommend over 10-inch Dobsonians or premium 6-inch reflectors that offer vastly more light grasp and flexibility for the same budget.</p>

<h2>Optics</h2>

<p>The ETX 125 uses Meade’s UHTC-coated 125 mm Maksutov-Cassegrain optics and an imposing 1900 mm focal length. The combination produces razor-sharp images with zero diffraction spikes or chromatic aberration—exactly what you want for planets and the Moon. Fine detail remains crisp at high magnifications, and the scope snaps to focus with little effort.</p>

<p>That long focal length, however, means an extremely narrow field. Large nebulae and galaxies simply won’t fit in the eyepiece, and the 5-inch aperture doesn’t gather enough light to make faint deep-sky targets pop. The ETX 125 is unapologetically a planetary specialist.</p>

<h2>Planetary Performance</h2>

<p>On the Solar System, the ETX 125 shines. It resolves Jupiter’s Galilean moons, cloud belts, and the Great Red Spot; Saturn’s rings and Titan; the phases of Venus; major features on Mars; and a wealth of craters and mountain chains on the Moon. The scope’s generous focal length makes it easy to reach the higher powers needed for planetary observing without running into focus travel issues or image breakdown.</p>

<h2>Deep-Sky Performance</h2>

<p>Point the ETX 125 at deep-sky objects and the picture changes. The narrow field of view makes sweeping the Milky Way or framing extended nebulae frustrating, while the modest aperture keeps galaxies and clusters on the dim side. Enthusiasts seeking a general-purpose deep-sky instrument will find better value elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Astrophotography</h2>

<p>The ETX 125 accepts DSLR bodies via the internal flip mirror or the rear port, making quick snapshots of the Moon or planets possible. Long-exposure astrophotography is off the table: the mount isn’t designed for precise tracking, and exposures longer than about 20 minutes will drift. Meade includes an equatorial wedge plate, but in practice it is difficult to polar align accurately enough for serious imaging.</p>

<h2>Mount and Tripod</h2>

<p>The mount itself is much improved over the plastic-laden ETX 80 and 90. The clutches are firm, the connections feel solid, and the metal drivetrain translates into smoother slewing. The steel tripod is similarly confidence-inspiring. The one glaring omission is power: Meade ships the ETX 125 without an internal battery, leaving users to burn through eight AA cells in a single session or resort to an external power supply.</p>

<h2>GoTo and AudioStar</h2>

<p>GoTo and AutoStar tracking continue to be the ETX family’s strongest selling point. Alignment is quick—point north, enter your location, center a couple of stars—and the scope will place targets within the eyepiece and follow them for 15–20 minutes before needing minor tweaks. The built-in “audio tour,” on the other hand, remains a novelty that most observers will ignore in favor of modern mobile apps.</p>

<h2>Accessories</h2>

<p>Meade includes 26 mm and 9.7 mm Plössl eyepieces, a red-dot finder, and the internal flip mirror. The eyepieces are adequate for getting started, but serious users will want to upgrade to higher-quality oculars. The flip mirror can be useful for daytime terrestrial imaging or quickly swapping to a camera, although attaching a DSLR directly to the rear port preserves the brightest view for astrophotography.</p>

<h2>Drawbacks</h2>

<p>The biggest strike against the ETX 125 is price. While the build quality fixes are welcome, they don’t justify a $700 tag when larger and more capable telescopes are available for the same money. The battery situation is equally irksome—burning through AA batteries nightly is wasteful, and sourcing an external supply adds yet another expense. Lastly, the scope’s narrow field and limited aperture leave deep-sky performance lacking.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you can solve the power issue, the ETX 125 delivers excellent planetary views in a compact, computerized package. But at its current price, better options exist. A 10-inch Dobsonian or a high-quality 6-inch reflector offers more capability for the same investment. Unless you need the ETX 125’s portability and GoTo convenience, save your budget for a larger aperture or a truly robust astro-imaging setup.</p>
