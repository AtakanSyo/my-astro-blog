  <h2>A Guided Journey Through Our Solar System</h2>
  <p>
    Our Solar System—born some 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of
    gas and dust—is more than just the Sun and its family of planets. It’s a
    living, breathing laboratory where worlds take shape, atmospheres
    transform, and ice and rock mingle in distant belts. Join us as we voyage
    from the fiery heart of our star to the frozen outskirts of the Kuiper Belt.
  </p>

  <h3>The Sun: A Pulsing Beacon of Energy</h3>
  <p>
    Containing over 99.8 % of the system’s mass, the Sun is a G-type
    main-sequence star whose core fuses roughly 600 million tons of hydrogen
    into helium every second. That fusion unleashes the sunlight and solar wind
    that sculpt planetary atmospheres, power ocean currents on Earth, and drive
    space weather that can both dazzle and disrupt human technology.
  </p>

  <h3>The Inner Rocky Worlds: Forged in Fire</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Mercury</strong> (0.39 AU) – A hulled remnant of early planet
      formation, cratered and airless. Temperatures swing from –173 °C under the
      night sky to 427 °C when the Sun rises over its horizon.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Venus</strong> (0.72 AU) – Swathed in sulfuric-acid clouds and a
      carbon-dioxide atmosphere 90 times Earth’s pressure, Venus endures a
      runaway greenhouse effect that heats its surface to a hellish 465 °C.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Earth</strong> (1 AU) – Our oasis of liquid water, plate tectonics,
      and a nitrogen-oxygen envelope. Its single large moon stabilizes tilt,
      seasons, and the rhythmic ebb and flow of life.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mars</strong> (1.52 AU) – The “Red Planet” boasts colossal volcanoes,
      polar ice caps, and valley networks carved by ancient water. Today it
      stands as the prime target for robotic explorers—and future human visitors.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Gas and Ice Giants: Titans of the Outer Realm</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Jupiter</strong> (5.2 AU) – More than 300 times Earth’s mass, its
      banded clouds and Great Red Spot testify to storms that have raged for
      centuries. Jupiter’s gravity shepherds asteroids in the asteroid belt and
      flings comets into the inner Solar System.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Saturn</strong> (9.6 AU) – Encircled by icy rings made of countless
      particles from dust to house-sized chunks, Saturn hosts Titan—whose
      dense atmosphere harbors methane lakes—and Enceladus, whose south-polar
      geysers hint at a hidden ocean.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Uranus</strong> (19.2 AU) – An ice giant tilted on its side, its
      27 moons and faint rings trace a path nearly perpendicular to the plane
      of the planets, revealing a dramatic past collision.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Neptune</strong> (30 AU) – The most distant world we’ve visited
      up close, Neptune endures supersonic winds exceeding 2 000 km/h. Its
      largest moon, Triton, may be a captured Kuiper Belt object, complete with
      its own geysers.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Dwarf Planets and Small Bodies: Cosmic Time Capsules</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt—a vast ring of icy bodies including
    Pluto, Eris, and Makemake. Closer in, the asteroid belt between Mars and
    Jupiter contains rocky leftovers from the Solar System’s construction.
    Farther still, the Oort Cloud—an immense, hypothetical shell of icy
    planetesimals—lurks as the reservoir of long-period comets that streak
    through our skies once in a lifetime.
  </p>

  <h3>Why We Explore</h3>
  <p>
    Each mission—Voyager’s grand tour, Cassini’s dive through Saturn’s rings,
    the Perseverance rover’s search for ancient microbial life—unwraps a new
    chapter in our cosmic story. By comparing these worlds, we learn how
    planets form, how climates evolve, and where life might take root beyond
    Earth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, with the interactive simulation above, you can toggle orbits,
    distances, labels, and speed to see every planet in motion. Adjust the
    view, hit “play,” and watch the dance of gravity that has shaped—and
    continues to shape—our celestial neighborhood. Safe travels on your
    voyage through the final frontier!
