  <p>
    Above is a <strong>GPU-accelerated, real-time visualization of Uranus</strong>, the pale-blue ice giant of our Solar System.
    Uranus is unique for its <strong>extreme axial tilt</strong> of about 98°, causing it to essentially roll around the Sun on its side.
    The simulation captures its smooth atmosphere, subtle high-altitude haze, and faint ring system.
  </p>

  <h3 id="what-youre-seeing">What you’re seeing</h3>
  <p>
    Uranus has a featureless appearance in visible light, but its atmosphere contains faint cloud bands and occasional storms.
    The blue-green color is due to methane in the upper atmosphere absorbing red light.
    Its rotation period is about 17 hours, but because of the sideways tilt, the planet’s poles alternately point almost directly at the Sun during its 84-year orbit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The model includes <strong>faint, narrow rings</strong> discovered in 1977, shown at an exaggerated brightness for visibility.
    Lighting comes from a fixed Sun position, and the simulation incorporates a limb-darkening effect to soften the planet’s edges.
  </p>

  <h2 id="observing-uranus">Observing Uranus</h2>
  <p>
    Uranus is visible in dark skies with binoculars or a small telescope as a tiny bluish disk.
    Even with larger amateur telescopes, surface detail is minimal, though the color is distinct.
    The rings are far too faint to be seen without space telescopes or spacecraft like Voyager 2, which flew by in 1986.
  </p>

  <h2 id="tech-notes">Tech notes</h2>
  <p>
    This visualization runs in <strong>WebGL2</strong> by default with ACES tone mapping and sRGB correction.
    The shader blends a smooth gradient base with subtle noise to suggest atmospheric variation.
    A transparent ring mesh with additive blending represents the ring system.
    WebGPU support, if enabled, can improve performance and precision.
    This is a visual approximation intended for educational purposes, not a fluid-dynamics or atmospheric simulation.
