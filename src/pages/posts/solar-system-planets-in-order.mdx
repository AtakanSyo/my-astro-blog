<figcaption class="sim-caption">
  Each planet appears at the same apparent radius so you can focus entirely on color, texture, and atmospheric personality. Order, left to right: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

<div class="sim-article">
  <h2 id="same-size-different-worlds">Same size, different worlds</h2>
  <p>
    Strip away diameter differences and a new kind of comparison emerges. When every planet shares the same silhouette, details like
    Jupiter’s rust-colored belts, Earth’s blue oceans, or Mars’s dust storms jump to center stage. You can even spot the retrograde
    rotation of Venus and Uranus as they slowly turn opposite the others.
  </p>

  <h3 id="color-palette">Color palette tour</h3>
  <p>
    Move along the row from Mercury’s scorched greys through Venus’s thick clouds and Earth’s vibrant blues. The outer worlds glow with
    muted pastels: Jupiter shifts between ochres and creams, Saturn shows buttery shades, while Uranus and Neptune lean toward icy cyan.
    Uniform sizing keeps your eye on those subtle gradients.
