  <p>
    Kilonovae arise from the merger of compact objects—typically two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole.
    As they spiral together via gravitational-wave emission, tidal forces rip neutron-rich shrapnel from their crusts.
    The merger ejecta expand at up to 0.3c and power a fast-rising optical transient once radioactive heating kicks in.

    The ejected matter is a crucible for r-process nucleosynthesis, forging heavy elements such as gold, platinum, and
    uranium. Depending on the ejecta’s composition, the kilonova displays a blue component (lanthanide-poor, polar winds)
    and a redder component (lanthanide-rich, equatorial tidal tails). Observations of GW170817 confirmed this two-component
    color evolution, providing the first smoking gun for neutron-star-origin heavy elements.

  <h3 id="signals-across-the-spectrum">Signals across the spectrum</h3>
  <p>
    Kilonovae are multi-messenger events. They emit gravitational waves during inspiral, prompt gamma-ray bursts when
    jets punch through the debris, optical/infrared light from radioactive heating, and long-lived radio/X-ray afterglows
    as ejecta plow into interstellar gas. Coordinated follow-up lets astronomers weigh the merger remnant and probe the
    neutron-star equation of state.
  </p>

  <h3 id="cosmic-distance-markers">Cosmic distance markers</h3>
  <p>
    Because gravitational-wave signals encode absolute distances, kilonovae paired with host-galaxy redshifts serve as
    “standard sirens” for measuring the universe’s expansion. Future events observed by LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the upcoming
    Einstein Telescope will refine the Hubble constant and reveal how often neutron stars collide throughout cosmic history.
