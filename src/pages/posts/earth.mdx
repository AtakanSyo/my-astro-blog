<h2>What you’re seeing</h2>
<p>This simulation shows Earth as a planetary sphere, using a true cloud and surface texture. Continents, oceans, and polar ice are visible. A subtle atmospheric glow surrounds the disk, giving Earth its distinct blue halo when viewed from space.</p>

<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>Earth is the only planet known from the perspective of living on it. Ancient civilizations assumed Earth was the center of the universe until astronomical observations and the heliocentric model revealed it as one planet orbiting the Sun. Its true nature as a sphere was established through observations dating back to classical Greece.</p>

<h2>Distance from the Sun</h2>
<p>Earth is the <strong>3rd planet from the Sun</strong>. Its average orbital distance is about 149.6 million km (1 AU by definition). Earth completes one orbit in 365.25 days, giving rise to the calendar year and leap-year cycle.</p>

<h2>Special qualities</h2>
<p>Earth is the only known world with stable liquid water on the surface and a biosphere that supports complex life. Its magnetic field shields the surface from charged particles, and the atmosphere keeps temperatures suitable for habitability. Tectonic activity recycles carbon and regulates climate over geologic time.</p>

<h2>Moons</h2>
<p>Earth has one natural satellite: the Moon. Its gravitational influence stabilizes Earth’s axial tilt and drives tides, affecting climate and biological rhythms.</p>

<h2>Size and mass</h2>
<p>Earth has a diameter of 12,742 km. Its mass is approximately 5.97 × 10^24 kg, giving Earth the strongest gravity among terrestrial planets and allowing it to retain a dense atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Chemistry and atmosphere</h2>
<p>Earth’s atmosphere is dominated by nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace gases such as carbon dioxide regulating greenhouse effects. The surface is a mixture of oceans (71%) and continents shaped by erosion, volcanism, and plate tectonics.</p>

<h2>Name and meaning</h2>
<p>“Earth” comes from Old English eorþe and Germanic erde, meaning “ground” or “soil.” It is the only planet not named after a Greek or Roman god. In Latin-based scientific contexts, Earth is sometimes called Terra, giving us terms like “terrestrial.”</p>
