  <p>
    Above is a <strong>GPU-accelerated, real-time visualization of the Moon</strong>, Earth’s only natural satellite.
    The simulation uses high-resolution shading to highlight craters, maria, and highlands, along with a realistic phase cycle as seen from Earth.
  </p>

  <h3 id="what-youre-seeing">What you’re seeing</h3>
  <p>
    The Moon rotates once on its axis in the same amount of time it takes to orbit Earth — about 27.3 days — a phenomenon known as <strong>tidal locking</strong>.
    This is why we always see the same lunar hemisphere. The visible side is marked by dark basalt plains called <em>maria</em> and brighter highland regions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lighting comes from a fixed Sun position, producing realistic shadows in craters and mountains.
    A limb-darkening effect makes the edge appear softer, matching the way light scatters off the surface and into the vacuum of space.
    The simulation also reproduces the Moon’s changing phase, from new to full and back, depending on its position relative to Earth and the Sun.

  <h2 id="observing-the-moon">Observing the Moon</h2>
  <p>
    The Moon is one of the easiest and most rewarding objects to observe in the night sky.
    Even binoculars reveal craters, ridges, and maria in detail, while a small telescope can provide breathtaking close-up views.
    The best time to observe is near first or last quarter, when shadows are longest and features stand out in sharp relief.
  </p>

  <p>
    This visualization runs in <strong>WebGL2</strong> by default with physically based rendering (PBR) and ACES tone mapping.
    A high-detail displacement map and normal map provide surface relief, while the shader dynamically adjusts lighting for accurate phase rendering.
    On compatible browsers, enabling WebGPU can enhance performance and shading precision.
    This is an educational visualization, not a scientific terrain simulation, though it is based on real lunar imagery.
