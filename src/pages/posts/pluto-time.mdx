<p>In 2006, NASA launched its New Horizons mission ‚Äî the first spacecraft ever sent to explore Pluto up close. 
Its goal was to fly past Pluto, photograph its surface in detail, and study its atmosphere and composition. 
As the spacecraft approached Pluto in 2015, NASA wanted to spark excitement, curiosity, and a bit of fun, 
so they created a website called ‚ÄúPluto Time.‚Äù</p>

<p>On that website, if you enter your location (or allowed the browser to detect it), it would calculate a precise 
moment during your day when the brightness of the sky ‚Äî right where you were standing ‚Äî matched the brightness 
of high noon on Pluto.</p>

<p>We wanted to honor that mission with a similar tool of our own ‚Äî a slightly more modern version. üôÇ</p>
