    Hit play to watch thousands of embers rocket away from the center.  
    Every particle in this simulation represents ejected stellar matter from a
    <strong>Type Ia supernova</strong> — the thermonuclear explosion of a white
    dwarf. The glow fades as particles travel outward at nearly constant speed,
    capturing the clean, spherical symmetry of this kind of supernova.

    The visualization exposes a simple API: pass <code>explosionType="typeIa"</code>
    to the component. The helper automatically applies the Type Ia velocity
    distribution and keeps the expansion almost uniform in every direction.
    Particle count, lifetime, and color are still yours to tweak for scientific
    accuracy or pure visual style.

  <h3 id="explosion-profile">Type Ia — how it works</h3>
  <p>
    A white dwarf in a binary system steals matter from its companion. When it
    crosses the critical mass limit (the Chandrasekhar limit), a runaway
    thermonuclear reaction ignites the entire star. Unlike core–collapse
    supernovae, a Type Ia does not leave behind a neutron star or black hole —
    the white dwarf is obliterated completely.
  </p>
  <p>
    In physics terms, Type Ia ejecta expands <strong>nearly homologously</strong>:
    material flies outward at almost constant velocity regardless of direction.
    In the sim, that means:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Particles start with nearly identical speeds.</li>
    <li>The outflow forms a smooth, spherical shell.</li>
    <li>No jets, no poles — just pure thermonuclear symmetry.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    What you are seeing is a clean visualization of <em>thermonuclear free expansion</em> —
    the iconic signature that makes Type Ia supernovae invaluable standard candles in cosmology.
