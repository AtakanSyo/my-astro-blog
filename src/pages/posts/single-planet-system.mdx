  <p>
    This minimalist scene showcases a one-planet stellar neighborhood viewed straight down from interstellar space.
    The star stays fixed at the focus of an eccentric orbit, while the planet glides along the path with a configurable orbital period,
    axial tilt, and day length. The orbit is scaled for readability, but the timing stays consistent—pause and resume whenever you want
    to inspect where the planet is along its year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because there is only one world to watch, you can pay close attention to how the star's light rakes across the surface as the planet rotates.
    A subtle additive atmosphere keeps the limb glowing, and a dashed orbit line makes it easy to see where apoapsis and periapsis fall.
  </p>

  <h3 id="what-to-look-for">What to look for</h3>
  <p>
    Notice how the orbital speed stays uniform even though the path stretches into an ellipse—this keeps the visualization calm and legible.
    Toggle the pause control when the planet is closest to the star to compare its scale against the stellar disk. Because axial tilt is applied,
    the day/night terminator sweeps diagonally, hinting at seasons you might expect on such a world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try watching for beats between rotation and orbital motion. Retrograde spins or slower days can be configured via props when the component
    is reused, making this a handy sandbox for storytelling or teaching orbital basics.
