  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Spiral galaxies</strong> are among the most recognizable structures in the universe. Characterized by 
    sweeping arms of stars, gas, and dust winding outward from a luminous central bulge, they make up roughly 
    <em>two-thirds</em> of all galaxies in the local cosmos. The Milky Way, our home galaxy, is itself a barred 
    spiral, part of a vast population whose morphology reflects ongoing star formation, angular momentum 
    distribution, and the influence of dark matter halos.
  </p>

  <h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
  <p>
    A typical spiral galaxy consists of several key components:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Galactic Bulge:</strong> A dense, spheroidal region at the center dominated by older stars.  
      In barred spirals, this bulge is elongated into a bar structure that channels gas toward the core.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Spiral Arms:</strong> Curved lanes rich in gas, dust, and young, blue stars. These arms are 
      not rigid structures but <em>density waves</em>—regions where material becomes compressed as it orbits.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Galactic Disk:</strong> A thin, rotating plane of stars and interstellar matter where most 
      star formation occurs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dark Matter Halo:</strong> An extended, invisible component whose gravitational influence 
      shapes the rotation curve of the galaxy and stabilizes the disk.
    </li>
  </ul>

    }}

  <h2 id="dynamics">Dynamics and Rotation</h2>
  <p>
    The rotation of spiral galaxies is a fundamental clue to their mass distribution. Observations show that 
    the outer regions rotate nearly as fast as the inner regions—a phenomenon inconsistent with the visible 
    matter alone. This discrepancy provided early evidence for the existence of 
    <strong>dark matter</strong>, which forms a massive halo enveloping the galaxy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spiral arms persist because they are not fixed collections of stars; instead, they are patterns formed as 
    stars and gas pass through rotating density waves, similar to how cars bunch up in slow-moving traffic.
  </p>

  <h2 id="formation">Formation and Evolution</h2>
  <p>
    Spiral galaxies are thought to form from the collapse of rotating gas clouds early in cosmic history. 
    Over billions of years, continued accretion of gas, minor mergers, and internal dynamical processes 
    have shaped their current appearance. Their ongoing star formation distinguishes them from elliptical 
    galaxies, which have largely exhausted their gas reservoirs.
  </p>

  <h2 id="types">Classification</h2>
  <p>
    Astronomers classify spiral galaxies using the Hubble sequence:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SA / SB / SAB:</strong> Unbarred, barred, and weakly barred spirals.</li>
    <li><strong>a / b / c:</strong> A scale indicating how tightly the arms are wound and the size of the bulge.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For example, an <strong>SBc</strong> galaxy features a prominent bar, loose spiral arms, and a relatively 
    small bulge.
  </p>

  <h2 id="what-to-look-for">What to Look For</h2>
  <p>
    When observing real spiral galaxies—through telescopes or astrophotography—note the contrast between 
    brightly lit star-forming arms and the darker dust lanes that trace the underlying structure.  
    The central bulge often shines with a warmer, more yellow light due to its older stellar population.
  </p>
  <p>
    Edge-on views reveal thin dust lanes cutting across the disk, while face-on views showcase the full 
    geometric beauty of the spiral pattern.
