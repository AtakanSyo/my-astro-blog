    This Cassini image of Saturn captures the planet divided 
    neatly between day and night, with its famous rings stretched out like a cosmic blade.

  <h2>The Thin Edge of Saturn’s Rings</h2>
  <p>
    From this angle, the rings appear almost invisible—just a sharp line crossing the planet’s face.  
    In reality, they span more than 120,000 kilometers across, but are astonishingly thin, often 
    no more than tens of meters thick. Cassini’s view shows how fragile and delicate these structures 
    really are when seen edge-on.

  <h2>Light and Shadow on the Giant</h2>
  <p>
    The dark half of Saturn is not entirely featureless: faint cloud bands and storms swirl even in 
    shadow, revealing the planet’s restless atmosphere. The bright half, washed in sunlight, contrasts 
    sharply against the inky blackness of space, emphasizing Saturn’s sheer size.

  <h2>A Cassini Perspective</h2>
  <p>
    Cassini, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, often delivered these unusual views by taking 
    advantage of geometry and shadow. While telescopes on Earth can show Saturn’s rings tilted or 
    face-on, only a spacecraft could reveal them like this—flattened into a razor-thin slash, reminding 
    us of their elegance.
