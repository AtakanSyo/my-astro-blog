  <h2>A Guided Tour of Our Solar System</h2>
  <p>
    Our Solar System is a vast and dynamic neighborhood bound together by
    gravity, centered on the Sun and populated by eight diverse planets, their
    moons, and countless smaller bodies.
  </p>

  <h3>The Sun: Heart of the System</h3>
  <p>
    The Sun contains more than 99.8 % of the entire mass of the Solar System. It
    is a G-type main-sequence star, powered by nuclear fusion in its core that
    converts hydrogen into helium, releasing the light and heat that sustain
    life on Earth.
  </p>

  <h3>The Inner Rocky Worlds</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Mercury</strong> – The smallest planet, crater-pocked and
      airless, orbits at just 0.39 AU (≈ 58 million km). Its temperature swings
      from –173 °C at night to 427 °C in daytime.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Venus</strong> – A thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere traps heat in
      a runaway greenhouse effect. With surface pressures 90 times that of
      Earth, Venus’s clouds hide a scorching 465 °C surface.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Earth</strong> – Our home, at 1 AU (≈ 150 million km), enjoys
      liquid water, a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, and plate tectonics. Its
      single large moon stabilizes axial tilt and seasons.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mars</strong> – The “Red Planet” lies at 1.52 AU. With polar ice
      caps and evidence of ancient rivers, Mars is a prime target for robotic
      —and eventually human—exploration.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Gas and Ice Giants</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Jupiter</strong> – Over 300 times Earth’s mass, Jupiter’s
      swirling bands and the Great Red Spot showcase powerful storms. Its
      strong gravity shepherds asteroids and comets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Saturn</strong> – Famous for its icy rings, Saturn has dozens of
      moons, including Titan (with a thick nitrogen atmosphere) and Enceladus
      (which jets water vapor from its south pole).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Uranus</strong> – An “ice giant” tipped on its side, it orbits at
      19.2 AU. Its faint rings and 27 moons orbit in a plane nearly
      perpendicular to the ecliptic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Neptune</strong> – At 30 AU, Neptune is the outermost planet,
      with supersonic winds that can exceed 2 000 km/h and 14 known moons,
      including Triton, which may be a captured Kuiper Belt object.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Dwarf Planets and Small Bodies</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, home to dwarf planets like
    <strong>Pluto</strong>, <strong>Eris</strong>, and <strong>Makemake</strong>.
    Closer in, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter contains rocky
    remnants of the early Solar System. Comets from the distant Oort Cloud
    visit only occasionally, painting iconic tails when they approach the Sun.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Explore?</h3>
  <p>
    Studying other worlds teaches us about planetary formation, climate
    evolution, and the potential for life elsewhere. Robotic missions—
    Voyager, Cassini, Perseverance—and telescopic surveys continue to enrich
    our understanding and inspire future explorers.
  </p>

    With the interactive simulation above, you can toggle orbits, distances,
    labels, and speed to see how each planet moves in real time. Enjoy your
    voyage through our cosmic backyard!
