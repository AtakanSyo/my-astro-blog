description: The Quadrantids peak each January 3–4 as Earth passes through debris from asteroid 2003 EH1, producing fast, bright meteors that radiate from the northern sky. Best seen from the Northern Hemisphere, the shower is brief but can be impressively intense under dark skies.

import Countdown from '../../../components/Countdown.astro';

The Quadrantids start the year with one of the sharpest, most intense meteor peaks. The 2026 burst arrives in the pre-dawn hours of **January 3**, favoring the Northern Hemisphere with potentially **60–120 meteors per hour** under dark skies.

<h3>Why does it happen?</h3>
<p>
The Quadrantids meteor shower occurs because Earth passes through a stream of debris left behind by the parent body <strong>asteroid 2003 EH1</strong>, which is likely the remnant of an extinct comet. As Earth moves through this debris each January, tiny particles enter the atmosphere at extremely high speeds and burn up, creating bright meteor streaks.
</p>

<h3>Does it happen at the same time each year?</h3>
<p>
Yes. The Quadrantids peak around <strong>January 3–4</strong> every year because Earth crosses the same section of the debris stream at the same point in its orbit. The exact peak hour shifts slightly from year to year, but the date range remains consistent.
</p>

<h3>What am I seeing when I look up?</h3>
<p>
You are seeing tiny dust grains, pebble-sized fragments, and occasionally larger rocky particles that hit Earth’s atmosphere at high speed. These particles heat up due to friction and glow brightly, creating the streaks of light we call meteors. Larger fragments can produce very bright fireballs.
</p>

<h3>Where on Earth can it be seen?</h3>
<p>
The Quadrantids are best observed from the <strong>Northern Hemisphere</strong>. Countries at mid- to high-northern latitudes—such as Turkey, Europe, the United States, Canada, Russia, and Japan—get the best view. The shower is far less visible in the Southern Hemisphere.
</p>

<h3>What will it look like?</h3>
<p>
Observers under dark skies may see bright, fast streaks radiating from a point in the northern sky near the former constellation Quadrans Muralis, now part of <strong>Boötes</strong>. Under ideal conditions, the Quadrantids can produce <strong>60–100 meteors per hour</strong>, though the peak lasts only a few hours. The best viewing time is typically after midnight and before dawn.
