    <h3 class="home-notice-title">Our Rating System</h3>
    <p class="home-notice-text">
      Our ratings are based on hands-on experience and expert judgment of each telescope or product.  
      In the end itâ€™s an arbitrary ranking systemâ€”feel free to draw your own conclusions from our reviews and posts.

    <h3 class="home-notice-title">Where to buy?</h3>
    <p class="home-notice-text">
      Consider choosing HighPointScientific as your main vendor, as it is a community favorite
      in terms of shipment safety, refunds, and product quality. Amazon is a viable choice, however it is 
      known for shipping astronomy equipment with missing pieces, and problematic refund processes.

    <h3 class="home-notice-title">Affiliate Notice</h3>
    <p class="home-notice-text">
      We have affiliate programs with Amazon, HighPointScientific, and Astroshop.  
      If you click on a link and make a purchase, we will get a small percentage as commission.  
      However, our reviews and ratings stay honestâ€”your satisfaction with the product increases our trustworthiness  
      and benefits this website more than any immediate affiliate income.
