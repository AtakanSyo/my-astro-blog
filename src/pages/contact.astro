        Have a question about a page, found an issue, or want to collaborate? I read every message.
        Email is best, but you can also reach me on social if that is easier.

          The fastest way to reach me is email: <strong><a href={`mailto:${email}`}>{email}</a></strong>.

        <h2>Collaboration & Reviews</h2>
        <p>
          Brands and creators: I am open to collaborations, product loans, and review units if they fit the
          audience. Share your timeline, what makes the gear interesting, and any testing requirements.

        <h2>Community</h2>

          You can also follow along on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok (links in the footer).
          DMs are fine for quick pings; for anything detailed, email works best.
